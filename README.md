# GNAF Ontology
An ontology for the content of the PSMA Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF).

The G-NAF is Australiaâ€™s authoritative, geocoded address file. It contains more than 13 million Australian physical address records. The records include geocodes which are latitude and longitude map coordinates with coordinate reference system details and other information necessary to precisely locate addresses on the earth's surface.

The G-NAF does not contain any names or personal information.

The base content of the G-NAF is available freely online at https://data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf and also via a Linked Data API that uses this ontology at http://gnafld.net.

This ontology draws some elements from the OWL ontology version of the ISO19160-1:2015 "Addressing -- Part 1: Conceptual model" standard (see https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html) which has been created by the ISO TC211, Group for Ontology Management (GOM) and published online by the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group at http://reference.data.gov.au/def/ont/iso19160-1-address.

## Implementation
The main documentation for this ontology is available online at this ontology's namespace location:

The code lists used by ontology implementations, derived from the GNAF relational data model, are all listed at:

The content of the GNAF database delivered according to this ontology, using its code lists and also implementing Linked Data principles is online at:
